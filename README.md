# CivitAI Browser+
Extension for [Automatic1111's Stable Difussion Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)  

This extension allows you to download models from CivitAi without leaving WebUI!  

This modified extension is based on [v1.1.0](https://github.com/SignalFlagZ/sd-civitai-browser/releases/tag/1.1.0) from [SignalFlagZ's Fork](https://github.com/SignalFlagZ/sd-civitai-browser)  


**NOTE: Search results are currently not impacted by the selected Base Model since the CivitAI API does not yet support this feature. If you'd like to have this feature, please upvote my feature request [here](https://civitai.featurebase.app/submissions/64ea19ac4f9cf39e6f9fb2e9) and [here](https://github.com/orgs/civitai/discussions/733)**

**If you're experiencing issues with broken or frozen downloads, there are two possible solutions you can try:**

1. **Disable Async DNS for Aria2**:
   If you're using any DNS manager program like PortMaster, try turning on the "Disable Async DNS for Aria2" option.

   ![Disable Async DNS for Aria2](https://github.com/BlafKing/sd-civitai-browser-plus/assets/9644716/3cf7fab3-0df5-4995-9543-d9824b7931ff)

2. **Revert to the old download method**:
   Another solution could be to disable the "Download models using Aria2" feature.  
This will switch back to the old download method, which may resolve the issue.

These settings can be found under the "Settings" tab in Web-UI and then under the "Civit AI" tile.

# Changelog üìã

<h3>v1.12.1</h3>

* File deletion now uses both SHA256 and file name to detect correct file.
* Fixed a bug where the default file was incorrect when selecting a model.
* Fixed a bug where Next Page caused an error when changing content type.
* Added settings option to toggle automatically inserting 2 default sub folders.

---
<h3>v1.12</h3>

* Added ability to load all selected installed models into browser in Update Models tab.
* Installed/outdated models check is now also done using SHA256 instead of only file name.
* Added ability to select multiple content Types when searching and scanning.
* Greatly improved speed of model installed/update scanning if model ID is in associated .json

---
<h3>v1.11.2</h3>

* Redesign of model page by [ManOrMonster](https://github.com/ManOrMonster)
* <details><summary>Model page changes (https://github.com/BlafKing/sd-civitai-browser-plus/pull/33)</summary>
   
   - Redesigned the look of the model page.
   - Added link to model page on CivitAI. Click on model name to open.
   - Added link to uploader/creator page on CivitAI. Click creator name to open.
   - Added CivitAI avatar display.
   - Separate description section.
   - First sample image is marked with data attribute and downloaded as preview image instead of grabbing first in model HTML. This guarantees that the first sample image (not avatar or image in description) is used when downloading the model.
   - Sample images are marked with data attribute so that only they are downloaded when using "Save Images" (no description images or avatar).
   - Removed trained tags from info since they are displayed above.
   - Each sample image has its own section.
   - Sample images zoom in when clicked, zoom out when clicking anywhere.
   - Forced width is removed from sample image URLs so that nice big images can be viewed.
   - Metadata is arranged so that the most commonly used data is at the top, no more searching for prompts.
   - Extra metadata is in accordion labeled "More details...". This is especially useful to hide insanely large ComfyUI JSON.
